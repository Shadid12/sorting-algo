-----------------------
The merge Sort I implemeted here has a time complexity of O(n*logn). This is a recursive merge sort that follows divide and conquere. The entire list must be iterated and this occurs O(log(n)) times (the input can only be halved O(log(n)) times). I am using a array in this merge sort which has a space complexity of O(m)

The Buble Sort that I implemented here has a time complexity of O(n^2). It has a space complexity of O(m).
